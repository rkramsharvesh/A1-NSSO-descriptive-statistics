**Introduction**
- This research examines the state of Karnataka and consumption data sourced from the National Sample
Survey Office (NSSO) to identify the top three and bottom three consuming districts of Karnataka. The
research will clean and prepare consumption data by addressing missing values and outliers. The
consumption-related dataset contains comprehensive information, such as data for urban and rural
sectors separately to be able to identify trends across the state of Karnataka in detail, as well as the
consumption data reported by districts, an administrative division representing local government. The
dataset will ultimately be imported for further analysis into R and Python. The objective of this research
is to inform both policymakers and commercial stakeholders, such as businesses/producers/distributors,
of emerging consumption trends in relation to consumption and costs across states, and the consumption
data emerging from Karnataka in particular, as a case study.

**Objectives**
- A. Identify any null values in the data set and, where they occur, substitute them with the mean of
the value of the respective variable;
- B. Identify the outlier data, summarise the outcome of the outlier detection processes, and take
appropriate action on the data;
- C. Substitute the district codes with the corresponding district names and recode the sectors (rural
and urban) field with meaningful labels;
- D. Summarise the major consumption variables by region and district, and identify the districts
with the highest total consumption and the lowest total consumption;
- E. Test for which mean consumption values (e.g., rural and urban sectors, highest and lowest
consumption districts) are statistically significantly different.
